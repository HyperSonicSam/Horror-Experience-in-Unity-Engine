# Horror-Experience-in-Unity-Engine
 A horror-like experience created in Unity, this game immerses players in a ruined bathroom with a basic puzzle to solve, enhanced by high-quality graphics and interactions. The game features over 1000 lines of C# code, utilizing a mix of non-copyrighted and self-recorded sounds, as well as textures sourced from free websites and captured with an iPhone 14 Plus. Visual Studio was used to manage various scripts based on different functionalities like player movement and light flickering, as well as the backend code. The development process was guided and optimized with the help of ChatGPT, enhancing both the code behavior and its time complexity.
